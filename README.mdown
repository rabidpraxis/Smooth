Smooth - Made for smead
-----------------------

An evolving javascript lib we use internally here at [The
Program](http://www.theprogrampdx.com) with our touchscreens. The goal is to
emulate iOS interactions as close as possible. This script includes the ability
for throwing, tapping, and sliding.

It is optimized for use with the Apple Safari browser.
